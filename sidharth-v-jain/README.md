# DevDigest

**DevDigest** is an AI-powered open-source and research intelligence workspace. It combines live GitHub repository information, semantic search over uploaded research papers, grounded question answering, and multi-agent technical briefings.

The application is split into a **Streamlit frontend** and a **FastAPI backend**. The backend integrates GitHub, Groq, ChromaDB, sentence-transformers, and CrewAI.

Backend: https://determine-rpg-politics-carb.trycloudflare.com/docs

## Current capabilities

### 1. GitHub Repository Explorer

- Search public GitHub repositories by keyword and optional programming language.
- Discover recently updated, popular repositories over day, week, or month windows.
- Inspect repository metadata, latest releases, and recent commits.
- Uses the GitHub REST API; an optional personal access token increases available API rate limits.

### 2. Research Assistant (PDF RAG)

- Upload text-based PDF research papers (15 MB maximum by default).
- Extract text and page information with PyMuPDF.
- Split extracted text into overlapping chunks.
- Generate embeddings with `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` by default.
- Persist embeddings, chunk text, and metadata in ChromaDB.
- Ask questions against all indexed documents or selected documents.
- Retrieve relevant passages and generate answers through Groq.
- Return source references with filenames, page numbers, and excerpts.
- Detect duplicate uploads using SHA-256 hashes.

**Limitations:** OCR is not included, so scanned/image-only PDFs are not supported unless they contain an embedded text layer. The uploaded original PDF files are not retained by the current RAG implementation; extracted chunks, embeddings, and metadata are stored in ChromaDB.

### 3. AI Briefings (CrewAI)

- Generate a technical briefing through a sequential **Researcher → Writer → Editor** CrewAI workflow.
- Use Groq as the LLM provider (`openai/gpt-oss-120b` by default; configurable with `GROQ_MODEL`).
- Include compact, live GitHub repository metadata, recent release information, and commit summaries.
- Optionally include relevant passages retrieved from indexed research papers.
- Add concise research notes.
- Produce a Markdown briefing with an executive summary, findings, implications, metrics where available, limitations, and source links.
- Download the generated briefing as a Markdown file.
- Includes custom CrewAI tools for Python package-version compatibility checks and benchmark comparisons.

**Current scope and testing note:** The briefing UI and API currently accept at most one GitHub repository per briefing. The current Researcher task is in tool-calling diagnostic mode: it is instructed to invoke the Python library compatibility checker once. The benchmark comparison tool is implemented and registered, but is not part of that diagnostic instruction. Once tool-calling behavior is validated across deployment, the diagnostic instruction can be replaced with normal evidence-led research instructions.

**Other limitations:** Briefing history is not persisted. The workflow is sequential, not hierarchical. The application has no user accounts or per-user document isolation.

## Requirements

- Python **3.12** is the tested project runtime. The repository includes `.python-version` set to `3.12` for platforms that honor it; also select Python 3.12 explicitly in Streamlit Community Cloud's deployment settings.
- A Groq API key for research Q&A and AI briefings.
- A GitHub token is optional, but recommended for higher GitHub API rate limits.
- Internet access is required for GitHub/Groq calls and the initial download of the embedding model.

The dependency files are separated for the two deployment services:

- `requirements.txt` — complete **backend** runtime dependencies; use this on Render.
- `frontend/requirements.txt` — minimal **Streamlit frontend** dependencies; Streamlit Community Cloud should install this file alongside `frontend/app.py`.
- `requirements-dev.txt` — test/development dependencies.

The CrewAI/LiteLLM/MCP versions are deliberately pinned because this project encountered provider compatibility problems with other combinations:

```text
crewai==1.15.33
litellm==1.105.1
mcp==1.30.0
```

These pins are intentional. Do not casually upgrade them without re-running the CrewAI + Groq tool-calling test.

## Local setup

### 1. Create a Python 3.12 environment

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 2. Install backend and frontend dependencies

For local development, install the complete backend dependencies and frontend dependencies into the same environment:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r frontend/requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Copy the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Configure at least:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
GROQ_MODEL=openai/gpt-oss-120b
BACKEND_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Optional GitHub authentication:

```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
```

RAG configuration defaults:

```env
CHROMA_PERSIST_DIR=./data/chroma
CHROMA_COLLECTION_NAME=devdigest_research
EMBEDDING_MODEL=sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
CHUNK_SIZE=1000
CHUNK_OVERLAP=150
RAG_TOP_K=5
MAX_PDF_SIZE_MB=15
```

Never commit `.env` or put real credentials in `.env.example`.

### 4. Start the backend

From the repository root:

```bash
uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

API documentation: <http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs>

Health check: <http://127.0.0.1:8000/health>

### 5. Start the frontend

In a second terminal, from the repository root:

```bash
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```

Open the local URL printed by Streamlit.

## Deployment

- FastAPI backend on Render.
- Streamlit frontend on Streamlit Community Cloud.
